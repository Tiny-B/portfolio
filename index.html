              for friends and really enjoyed the experience. I would link my Twitch account here but it is absolutely filthy, rated R, some of the things
              that came out of my mouth when streaming was unholy to say the least.

            <p class="art-text">I started drawing back in 2022, at first I was useless but after constant persistance I improved greatly, here is some of my best works,
              I also drew R rated images upon request for friends which was very fun to do.

              <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            </hgroup>
            <p>I am what i am, meaning i am no less and no more than what i feel, I have always wanted to become a gameplay programmer, so i learned how to use Unity
              I spent years just goofing around in the engine, learning constantly, I even learned how to use Blender to make 3D models, I realized that my games
              would just be programmer art visuals so I took it upon myself to improve my artistic skills with great success, my ultimate end goal is to
              integrate AI into gaming to enrich experiences. I have a passion for pokemon and my cat, I have adored pokemon since the 90s so it's a legacy interest for me,
              I have always been a gamer, my first consoles were SNES and Sega Genesis and i have had every console since. My cat Lola is such an adorable cat, she is my world
              and my whole world.
