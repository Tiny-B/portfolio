## My small portfolio piece

I went for a single page design to keep things fairly simple.
Each section is short and to the point.

I decided to use a sticky header for this reason, so navigation around the page was easier.
The idea to enlarge images upon hovering with the mouse was to let viewers see the artwork in a larger format, rather than open to
a new page.

For my color scheme I went for pinks and purples as they are my favorite with an easy on the eyes dark aesthetic.
